# Project Plan

## Research question

How well do Q-Learning and Policy Optimisation algorithms perform in model-free reinforcement learning?

## Description

Much work has been done in the study of machine learning for game playing. This project aims to explore model-free reinforcement learning algorithms; implement at least one reinforcement learning algorithm to perform successfully in an environment; and compare any implemented algorithms.

## Preliminary preparation 

- Understanding of PyTorch.
- Familiarity with OpenAI Gym.
- Understanding of the theory behind Q-Learning algorithms.
- Understanding of the theory behind Policy Optimisation algorithms.

## Objectives

### Must have

- Develop a Deep Q-Learning algorithm (DQN) to perform successfully in an OpenAI Gym environment.

### Should have

- Develop another deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG), and compare the approaches.

### Could have

- Implement a third deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to study the combination of Q-Learning and Policy Optimisation algorithms.
