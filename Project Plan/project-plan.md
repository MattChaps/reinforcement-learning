# Project Plan

## Anticipated outcome

A reinforcement learning agent that plays Backgammon successfully.

## Description

Much work has been done in the study of machine learning for game playing. This project aims to explore traditional implementations of reinforcement learning agents that play Backgammon successfully; implement at least one reinforcement learning algorithm to learn to play Backgammon; and compare any implemented algorithms.

## Preliminary preparation 

- Understanding of a library for machine learning (such as TensorFlow or PyTorch).
- Familiarity with the game Backgammon.
- Understanding of traditional reinforcement learning algorithms (such as temporal difference learning).
- Understanding of modern reinforcement learning algorithms (such as Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning).

## Objectives

### Must have

- Develop a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn to play Backgammon successfully.

### Should have

- Develop at least another reinforcement learning algorithm, and compare the approaches. The learning algorithms could be:
  - Q-learning, or
  - deep reinforcement learning.

### Could have

- Implement an interface for a user to play against the trained agents.
