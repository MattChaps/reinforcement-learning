# Chapter 2

## Multi-armed Bandits

- RL uses training information that _evaluates_ the actions taken rather than _instructs_ by giving correct actions. Evaluative feedback depends on the action taken, whereas instructive feedback is independent of the action take.

- In this chapter study evaluative aspect of RL in _nonassociative_ setting, which does not involve learning to act in more than one situation.
