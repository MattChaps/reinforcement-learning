## 1.4 Limitations and Scope

- Policy and value function take state as input. State is both input to and output from model.

  - State: signal conveying to agent "how the environment is" at particular time. (Whatever information is available to the agent about its environment.)

    - Assume signal is produced by some preprocesing system nominally part of the agent's environment.

- Most RL methods in this book structured around estimating value functions. Others such as evolutionary methods have advantage on problems in which learning agent cannot sense the complete state of its environment.

- Focus in this book is on RL methods that learn while interacting with the environment, which evolutionary methods do not do. Evolutionary methods do not use fact that policy they are searching for is a function from states to actions; they do not notice which states an individual passes through during its lifetime, or which actions it selects.
